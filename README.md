# Web-Automation---Islamicshopdk
I tested some functionality of a website named Islamic shop dhaka
An automation testing is done of a web application "Islamic Shop Dhaka" using Automation Testing tool Selenium.
It is a short project focusing on some functionality of the application.
I used POM to complete the project. Different classes are created for corresponding web pages.
First of all I created a "DriverSetup" class in utilities package.
In this class I prepared the driver setup, browswes to be used and annotations.
Then I created a class "BasePage" in the webpages package where I have defined all the necessary methods which are inherited in other classes.
There there are "IslamicshopHomePage", "ParticularBook", "PlaceorderPage" and "PlaceorderPage".
Here, I have performed automation testing on scrolling up and down of a webpage, selecting particular book, placing order providing necessary information.
Also performed some assertions like checking homepage title, homepage link. This project can be run using Testng parallely at method level.
Finally, I have produced allure report of the tests.
